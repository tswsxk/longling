# Architecture Tools for Constructing Projects

## notice

* In sphinx setting, the default setting in `sphinx-quickstart` would be

```
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]
```
Thus, default directory to the built files is `_build`.
If the `y` is chosen, the directory to the built files is `build`.
