This project aims to provide some handy toolkit functions to help construct the
architecture.

The project contains several modules for different purposes:
*  [lib](./lib/README.md) serves as the basic toolkit that 
can be used in any place without extra dependencies.

* [ML](./ML/README.md) provides many interfaces to quickly 
build machine learning tools.
